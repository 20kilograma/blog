# About
PHP is a dynamically typed, server-side scripting language, created in the 1990s. This language has been out for a while, and it's today's standard when someone mentions back-end development for the web.
When PHP was created, one of its most important features was that it could be directly embedded into HTML and create dynamic content, which led to its wide spread in the 2000s.
