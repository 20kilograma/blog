# About
PHP is a dynamically typed, server-side scripting language, created in the 1990s. This language has been out for a while, and it's today's standard when someone mentions back-end development for the web.
When PHP was created, one of its most important features was that it could be directly embedded into HTML and create dynamic content, which led to its wide spread in the 2000s. One of the biggest problems for developers
in the early versions of PHP was its Security. Early versions of PHP didn't have that many in-built security features like today, and PHP has improved since then sincerely. Blaming PHP when problems arise nowadays because you didn't sanitize user input, handle sessions properly, etc. is clearly a skill issue. In my opinion, today's community is still way too unaware of the issues that may arise. That is why I am writing this blog; hopefully someone will catch up with more stuff and learn something new. <br>
If someone is wondering why the name of this blog is "PHP beyond SQLi", I just wanted to make a little joke because many developers today only think about SQL Injection and preparing the statements because they heard they should do that, and maybe they heard about XSS too.
