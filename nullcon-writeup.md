Hello everyone! <br> Today I'm writing my writeup for the CTF Challenges on Nullcon that I've done.
Those challenges are all Web related and these are the challenges I've done: <code>TYpicalBoss</code>, <code>Debugger</code>, <code>IPfilter</code>, <code>Colorful</code>, <code>Magic Cars</code>.
<br>
Let's see now:
<br>
# > TYpicalBoss
This was probably the easiest one of all, since I already did some CTFs where <a href="https://secops.group/php-type-juggling-simplified/" target="_blank">PHP Type Juggling</a> was the key to it. <br>
This was the Description of TYpicalBoss Challenge: <br>
<code>
My boss just implemented his first PHP website. He mentioned that he managed to calculate a hash that is equal to 0??? I suppose he is not very experienced in PHP yet.
</code> after I read that I looked up at / and there were some files there and one important there was the .db file, I downloaded that file and opened it. <br>
I saw the Hash of the password from admin and already knew what it was about, since I already did <a href="https://secops.group/php-type-juggling-simplified/" target="_blank">PHP Type Juggling</a> challenges. <br>

The description and that Hash already made me think it's gonna be PHP Types, I first tried to find out which hashing algorithm it uses so I could search for a Magic Number/String that could match the Type for that algorithm.<br>
I tried figuring out the hashing algorithm by adding [] to the username/password parameter so I could get an PHP Error/Warning, that it is not an array, I may get some Info like that.<br>

I actually succeded, it's sha1! <br>After some Google Search I found this <code>10932435112</code> "Magic" Number that should work with sha1 algorithm and guess what, it actually worked.

<br>
I got the flag üòÅ: <code>ENO{m4ny_th1ng5_c4n_g0_wr0ng_1f_y0u_d0nt_ch3ck_typ35}</code>
