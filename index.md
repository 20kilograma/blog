# >> About | Kira Reys

Hello, I'm Kira Reys and I am interested in IT Stuff. I love learning new stuff in free time and spending time reading other write-ups so that inspirated me to make my own Blog. Currently I'm spending time to learn more stuff about Web & Web Pentesting. Most of the time I'm active on Discord so you can add or hang on any server. My goal by the end of this year is to spend more time learning GoLang,probably make one Tool or Contribution and to find few more bugs on H1.
